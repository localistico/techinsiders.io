title: Tech Insiders - Learn about the tech industry from the people that work on it
description: "Interviews with people working in the tech industry to learn: what their day to day at work is like, what they like about it, and how they got there"

<h2>What is Tech Insiders?</h2>

<p>One of the things we love the most about the tech industry is all the
different opportunities it has to offer depending on your interests and the
kind of company you might like. There’s something for everybody!

<p>Unfortunately, many people are not aware of all the opportunities that would
be a great fit for them or how they could get there.

<p>We are preparing some personal interviews with people who work in the
industry: what is their day to day work like, what do they like about it, how
did they get there… We want to provide a varied view on what working in the
tech industry is like and maybe some interviews will help people say "that’s
cool, I would love to do something similar!".
